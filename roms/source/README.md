```

The snapshot contains `JAC/src`, the upstream Action! build settings and build
script, and the reference ROM used by that script. It was generated with:

```sh
git archive --format=tar \
  --prefix=action-3.6-source-0b8bcedb/ \
  0b8bcedb9951acd84a1814d60e2eaeb0a93dd45f \
  JAC/src \
  JAC/build/Make-ACTION.bat \
  JAC/build/Make-Settings.bat \
  JAC/ref/rom/ACTION-36-ROM-OSS.rom \
  | gzip -n -9 > action-3.6-source-0b8bcedb.tar.gz
```

See `../ACTION-ROM-NOTICE.md` for license, provenance, and binary matching
details. This archive is checked in and included in the Cargo package alongside
the bundled cartridge.
